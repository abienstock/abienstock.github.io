I am a Senior Research Scientist at [J.P. Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) and [J.P. Morgan AlgoCRYPT CoE](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/initiatives/algocrypt-center-of-excellence). I obtained my PhD from the [Cryptography Lab](https://cs.nyu.edu/crg/cryptography/) at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) in 2023, where I was advised by [Professor Yevgeniy Dodis](https://cs.nyu.edu/~dodis/index.html) and [Professor Marshall Ball](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mmb586/index.html).
I was fortunate enough to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Google PhD Fellowship while at NYU.
Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in 2019, where I worked with [Professor Allison Bishop](https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com/).

I am interested in applied cryptography, particularly Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). My current research focuses on the intersection of MPC, Privacy, and Artificial Intelligence. I have also studied Secure (Group) Messaging, Private Set Intersection, and Private Outsourced Storage protocols in the past.
